<p>I am a <strong>Web Developer</strong> with skills in many languages and implementations such as front-end web, 
  embebbed systems, and mobile applications.<br> I currently apply my skillset in the <em>CyberSecurity</em> arena supporting 
Department of Defense objectives.<br> I'm passionate about design and problem solving and I strive to learn to better
hone my skills. I'm a leader of agile teams and I believe strongly in team member empowerment; this I have witnessed creates
an environment of high morale and productivity.</p>

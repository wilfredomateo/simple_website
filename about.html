  <p id='about_paragraph'>I am a Developer with skills in many languages and implementations such as front-end web, 
            embebbed systems, and mobile applications. I currently apply my skillset in the CyberSecurity arena supporting 
          Department of Defense objectives. I'm passionate about design and problem solving and I strive to learn to better
        hone my skills. I'm a leader of agile teams and I believe strongly in team member empowerment; this I have witnessed creates
        an environment of high morale and productivity.</p>

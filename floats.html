                <p>Direct personnel/cyberspace warfare operations. Coordinates w/ other operators performing weapons control, 
                surveillance, and network activities. Develops and executes tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). 
                Interprets directives into specific guidance and procedures for operator actions. Develops and executes 
                operations plans to ensure positive control of assigned resources. Evaluates operational readiness of communications, 
                sensors, intrusion detection, and related support equipment.</p>

                <p>Participates in research, development and operational testing and evaluation to determine new capabilities and modifications 
                to existing systems. Assesses and reverse engineers network nodes and infrastructure devices; to include operating systems 
                and software applications to determine capabilities, functionalities, limitations and vulnerabilities.</p>

                <p>Performs network attack activities to include effects gained from emerging technology such as: disruption, data manipulation, 
                degradation, destruction and denial of C2 while maintaining operational situational awareness.</p>

                <p>Conducts network defense operations of friendly forces and vital interests from hostile attacks. Defense techniques 
                consist of active and passive cyberspace operations including employment of defensive measures designed to deny attacking 
                adversaries or reduce their effectiveness. Network defense includes measures to preserve, protect, recover, and reconstitute 
                friendly cyberspace capabilities before, during, and after a hostile attack. Network defense encompasses cyberspace attack 
                deterrence, attack mitigation and survivability, attack attribution, vulnerability detection and response, data protection, 
                and infrastructure protection.</p>
